## Module 1:

**Vid 1 - Tracing Basics:** 
  Learnt that the @traceable function in LangSmith makes it easier to track function calls by automatically creating a structured "run tree." This feature lets you monitor performance, add metadata for filtering, and analyze execution flows more effectively.
  Changes made: Implemented using Groq's "openai/gpt-oss-120b" model, used HuggingFaceEmbeddings and FAISS for Embeddings and Vector db, tested additional prompts to the model
