# RISSHIKK-langsmith-MAT496

## Module 1:

**Vid 1 - Tracing Basics:** 
  Learnt that the @traceable function in langsmith makes it easier to track function calls by automatically creating a structured "run tree." This feature lets you monitor performance, add metadata for filtering, and analyze execution flows more effectively.
  Changes made: Implemented using Groq's "openai/gpt-oss-120b" model, used HuggingFaceEmbeddings and FAISS for Embeddings and Vector db, tested additional prompts to the model at the end

  Tweaked code: https://github.com/RISSHIKK/RISSHIKK-langsmith-MAT496/blob/main/Module%201/tracing_basics_final.ipynb

  **Vid 2 - Types of Runs:**
    Learnt how to set up observability for Langchain agents, covering LLM, retriever, and tool runs. It shows how to trace, log, visualize runs in langsmith, manage streaming outputs, format data, add tracking metadata, and use the langsmith playground for debugging and workflow optimization.
    Changes made: Implemented using Groq's "openai/gpt-oss-120b" model and tested my own examples at the end
